PdfFileWriter currently only works under Windows. 

It relies on System.Drawing, WPF, and System.Windows.Forms. In order to make it run on non-Windows platforms, vector and font drawing would need to move to a cross-platform drawing lib like [agg-sharp](https://github.com/MatterHackers/agg-sharp) or [mono/xwt](https://github.com/mono/xwt).
